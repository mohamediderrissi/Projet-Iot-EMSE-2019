## Objective
The main objective of the project is to integrate what we have done during the three courses in one project.
The three courses are:
+ [Internet-of-things](http://majinfo.gitlab.emse.fr/iot/)

              This course overviews the domain of Internet-of-things, which links physical world to the internet and the web. We put the emphasis on relevant technologies and real applications. Hardware-wise, we look at some technologies used in the industry (Orange), and some easy-to-develop ones, like Arduino and Raspberry. Communication-wise, we study the different layers (link, transport, application) required to develop an end-to-end IoT platform. The course is also complemented by an integrative project during which students
      This course will teach the following topics (may be modified):

      + Introduction to Internet-of-things
      + Ambient Computing
      + Applications in IoT and WoT (Smart home, smart grids)
      + Hardware (overview, Arduino, Raspberry)
      + Link Layer and Transport Layer Protocols
      + Application Layer Protocols
      + Data, formats and semantics
      + Context Management in IoT and WoT

+ [Distributed and Mobile Computing](https://www.emse.fr/~picard/cours/android/)
      
      This course explores client-serveur development architectures, development of J2E applications, and design and development of applications running on a mobile phone. This course will teach the following topics (may be modified):
        Server-side basic components
        Objects lifecycle
        Enterprise JavaBeans
        Introduction to mobile application development
        Web technologies and web standards (javascript, HTML5)
        Native and hybrid technologies (iOs, Android, Titanium)
      
     
 + Web Programming
  
        This course explores design and development techniques of web services. This course will teach the following topics (may be modified):
        Notion of web service
        Deefinition of web services
        Use cases
        SOAP – UDDI – WSDL
        HTTP protocol
        Presentation of the 3 components of web services (SOAP, UDDI, WSDL)
        Web services and J2EE, Servlet
        Tutorials and Lab works : Composition – Collaboration – Orchestration of services web
        Use of social networks APIs to develop applications (twitter, facebook, …)
